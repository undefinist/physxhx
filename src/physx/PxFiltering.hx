 * 
 * Filter method to specify how a pair of potentially colliding objects should be processed.
 * 
 * Collision filtering is a mechanism to specify how a pair of potentially colliding objects should be processed by the
 * simulation. A pair of objects is potentially colliding if the bounding volumes of the two objects overlap.
 * In short, a collision filter decides whether a collision pair should get processed, temporarily ignored or discarded.
 * If a collision pair should get processed, the filter can additionally specify how it should get processed, for instance,
 * whether contacts should get resolved, which callbacks should get invoked or which reports should be sent etc.
 * 
 * **Note**: A default implementation of a filter shader is provided in the PhysX extensions library, see `PxDefaultSimulationFilterShader`.
 * 
 * Return the PxFilterFlag flags and set the PxPairFlag flags to define what the simulation should do with the given collision pair.
 * 
 * This methods gets called when:
 * - The bounding volumes of two objects start to overlap.
 * - The bounding volumes of two objects overlap and the filter data or filter attributes of one of the objects changed
 * - A re-filtering was forced through `resetFiltering()` (see `PxScene::resetFiltering()`)
 * - Filtering is requested in scene queries
 * 
 * **Note**: Certain pairs of objects are always ignored and this method does not get called. This is the case for the
 * following pairs:
 * 
 * - Pair of static rigid actors
 * - A static rigid actor and a kinematic actor (unless one is a trigger or if explicitly enabled through `PxPairFilteringMode.eKEEP`)
 * - Two kinematic actors (unless one is a trigger or if explicitly enabled through `PxPairFilteringMode.eKEEP`)
 * - Two jointed rigid bodies and the joint was defined to disable collision
 * - Two articulation links if connected through an articulation joint
 * 
 * **Note**: This is a performance critical method and should be stateless. You should neither access external objects 
 * from within this method nor should you call external methods that are not inlined. If you need a more complex
 * logic to filter a collision pair then use the filter callback mechanism for this pair (see `PxSimulationFilterCallback`,
 * `PxFilterFlag.eCALLBACK`, `PxFilterFlag.eNOTIFY`).
 * 
 * @param attributes0 The filter attribute of the first object
 * @param filterData0 The custom filter data of the first object
