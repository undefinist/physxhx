	Kinematic actors are special dynamic actors that are not

	mass and can be moved around the world using the setKinematicTarget() method. They will push 
	regular dynamic actors out of the way. Kinematics will not collide with static or other kinematic objects.

	Kinematic actors are great for moving platforms or characters, where direct motion control is desired.

	You can not connect Reduced joints to kinematic actors. Lagrange joints work ok if the platform
	is moving with a relatively low, uniform velocity.

	**Sleeping:**
	- Setting this flag on a dynamic actor will put the actor to sleep and set the velocities to 0.
	- If this flag gets cleared, the current sleep state of the actor will be kept.

	The CCD minimum advance coefficient is a value in the range [0, 1] that is used to control the minimum amount of time a body is integrated when

	of the bodies involved in the contact. From these properties, a numeric value is calculated that determines the maximum distance (and therefore maximum time) 
	which these bodies could be integrated forwards that would ensure that these bodies did not pass through each-other. This value is then scaled by CCD minimum advance
	coefficient to determine the amount of time that will be consumed in the CCD pass.

	**Things to consider:** 
	A large value (approaching 1) ensures that the objects will always advance some time. However, larger values increase the chances of objects gently drifting through each-other in
	scenes which the constraint solver can't converge, e.g. scenes where an object is being dragged through a wall with a constraint.
	A value of 0 ensures that the pair of objects stop at the exact time-of-impact and will not gently drift through each-other. However, with very small/thin objects initially in 
	contact, this can lead to a large amount of time being dropped and increases the chances of jamming. Jamming occurs when the an object is persistently in contact with an object 
	such that the time-of-impact is	0, which results in no time being advanced for those objects in that CCD pass.

	The chances of jamming can be reduced by increasing the number of CCD mass @see PxSceneDesc.ccdMaxPasses. However, increasing this number increases the CCD overhead.
