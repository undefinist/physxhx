/**
Broad phase algorithm used in the simulation

eSAP is a good generic choice with great performance when many objects are sleeping. Performance
can degrade significantly though, when all objects are moving, or when large numbers of objects
are added to or removed from the broad phase. This algorithm does not need world bounds to be
defined in order to work.

eMBP is an alternative broad phase algorithm that does not suffer from the same performance
issues as eSAP when all objects are moving or when inserting large numbers of objects. However
its generic performance when many objects are sleeping might be inferior to eSAP, and it requires
users to define world bounds in order to work.

eABP is a revisited implementation of MBP, which automatically manages broad-phase regions.
It offers the convenience of eSAP (no need to define world bounds or regions) and the performance
of eMBP when a lot of objects are moving. While eSAP can remain faster when most objects are
sleeping and eMBP can remain faster when it uses a large number of properly-defined regions,
eABP often gives the best performance on average and the best memory usage.

/**
"Region of interest" for the broad-phase.

This is currently only used for the PxBroadPhaseType::eMBP broad-phase, which requires zones or regions to be defined
when the simulation starts in order to work. Regions can overlap and be added or removed at runtime, but at least one
region needs to be defined when the scene is created.

If objects that do no overlap any region are inserted into the scene, they will not be added to the broad-phase and
thus collisions will be disabled for them. A PxBroadPhaseCallback out-of-bounds notification will be sent for each one
of those objects.

The total number of regions is limited by PxBroadPhaseCaps::maxNbRegions.

The number of regions has a direct impact on performance and memory usage, so it is recommended to experiment with
various settings to find the best combination for your game. A good default setup is to start with global bounds
around the whole world, and subdivide these bounds into 4*4 regions. The PxBroadPhaseExt::createRegionsFromWorldBounds
function can do that for you.
