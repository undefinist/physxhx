    The difference between "normal" and "strong" friction is that the strong friction feature
    remembers the "friction error" between simulation steps. The friction is a force trying to
    hold objects in place (or slow them down) and this is handled in the solver. But since the
    solver is only an approximation, the result of the friction calculation can include a small
    "error" - e.g. a box resting on a slope should not move at all if the static friction is in
    action, but could slowly glide down the slope because of a small friction error in each 
    simulation step. The strong friction counter-acts this by remembering the small error and
    taking it to account during the next simulation step.

    However, in some cases the strong friction could cause problems, and this is why it is
    possible to disable the strong friction feature by setting this flag. One example is
    raycast vehicles, that are sliding fast across the surface, but still need a precise
    steering behavior. It may be a good idea to reenable the strong friction when objects
    are coming to a rest, to prevent them from slowly creeping down inclines.

    Note: This flag only has an effect if the PxMaterialFlag::eDISABLE_FRICTION bit is 0.

    When using the patch friction model, up to 2 friction anchors are generated per patch. As the number of friction anchors
    can be smaller than the number of contacts, the normal force is accumulated over all contacts and used to compute friction
    for all anchors. Where there are more than 2 anchors, this can produce frictional behavior that is too strong (approximately 2x as strong
    as analytical models suggest). 

    This flag causes the normal force to be distributed between the friction anchors such that the total amount of friction applied does not 
    exceed the analyical results.

/**
\brief enumeration that determines the way in which two material properties will be combined to yield a friction or restitution coefficient for a collision.

When two actors come in contact with each other, they each have materials with various coefficients, but we only need a single set of coefficients for the pair.

Physics doesn't have any inherent combinations because the coefficients are determined empirically on a case by case
basis. However, simulating this with a pairwise lookup table is often impractical.

For this reason the following combine behaviors are available:

eAVERAGE
eMIN
eMULTIPLY
eMAX
