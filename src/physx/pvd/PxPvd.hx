        Send memory information to PVD.

        The PVD sdk side hooks into the Foundation memory controller and listens to
        allocation/deallocation events.  This has a noticable hit on the first frame,
        however, this data is somewhat compressed and the PhysX SDK doesn't allocate much
        once it hits a steady state.  This information also has a fairly negligible
        impact and thus is also highly recommended.

        This flag works together with a PxCreatePhysics parameter,
        trackOutstandingAllocations.  Using both of them together allows users to have
        an accurate view of the overall memory usage of the simulation at the cost of
        a hashtable lookup per allocation/deallocation.  Again, PhysX makes a best effort
        attempt not to allocate or deallocate during simulation so this hashtable lookup
        tends to have no effect past the first frame.

        Sending memory information without tracking outstanding allocations means that
        PVD will accurate information about the state of the memory system before the
        actual connection happened.
